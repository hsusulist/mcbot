# Copy this file to `.env` and replace the placeholder with your Discord bot token
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Optional: configure the web server port
# PORT=3000

# Note: the repo previously used a Python bot; this Node server will serve `web/` and start
# a Discord bot only if `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set.
 
# Note: `SETUP_KEY` has been removed — bots can now be added via the web UI when
# a logged-in user posts a token. If you previously relied on a setup key, remove
# it from your `.env` or leave it blank.
